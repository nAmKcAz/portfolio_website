      role: `I joined this project 'late', about 5 months before early access release. My purpose was to help accelerate the release on the engineering side. I ended up contributing to this game on everything from PostgreSQL database tables matchmaking all the way up to Coherent Gameface UIs for gameplay and outgame systems.
      <div class=\"font-lg font-semibold mt-4\">Backend APIs/DBs</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">On the backend, I built out our APIs for Matchmaking and Accounts</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">The matchmaking service was built using a timed batch processing system and supported building parties across multiple maps and difficulties from queued players using a combination of factors including; number of matches played, player rank, relative player build strength, maps selected, difficulties selected, time in queue, relative cpu performance of player, locale/language of player, RTT to server of player, and estimated geo-location of players. The system also supported friend preferences, combining pre-made partial parties together, and player blacklists.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">The accounts service was built to manage the association of the multiple services accounts we were using including Steam, Unity Gaming Services, and Playfab as well as providing support for linking Twitch accounts and providing friend referral codes.</div>
      <div class=\"font-lg font-semibold mt-4\">Game Systems</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">I added multiple systems and their associated UI elements to our game.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Matchmaking integration to our backend APIs - Allowed selecting which Map(s) and Difficulties you wanted to queue for and managed the UI timers and queueing status updates for the player/party.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Accounts integration to our backend APIs & 3rd party services - Managed user login via Steam and used Steam auth tokens to also auth the player to Unity Gaming Services and Playfab.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Party Management, Friends, and Blacklists - Enabled players to manage their relationship with other players including inviting/kicking players from party, adding/removing friends - including Steam friends integration, blacklisting other players - including Steam ingtegration, and queueing for a match as a party.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Referral Codes - Generated a unique referral code for each player that they could use to refer their friends and get rewards in game based on the number of players they had referred.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Twitch Account Linking & Drops - Players could link their Twitch account and earn in game rewards based on their Twitch activity via Twitch Drops.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Chat - Integrated Unity Vivox chat into the game supporting both party and server chat channels.</div>
      <div class=\"font-lg font-semibold mt-4\">Netcode</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">This game's netcode was built using Fishnet. I was responsible for 'fixing' the netcode. I profiled and re-designed the usage of reliable vs unreliable network channels for various portions of our game traffic. I reduced the size and frequency of various payload state updates, adjusted some of the reconciliation/prediction logic, and ultimately got the game into a good state where players across multiple timezones were able to play in a single match without notable lag or delay.</div>
      <div class=\"font-lg font-semibold mt-4\">Performance/Scaling</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Similar to what I did for Netcode, one of my main responsibilities for this game was to 'fix' the performance.</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">These efforts covered 3 main areas...
          <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>Player FPS/Memory - I profiled and micro-optimized game code across nearly every system, from netcode updates, to timelines, to state machines, to effects processing, etc. This included allocation reductions and Unity specific code optimizations.</li>
            <li>Server FPS/Memory - Being a server hosted game, it was critical that both CPU usage and memory usage stayed as low as possible so that we could run as many instances as possible on a single AWS Gamelift server. A lot of the Client FPS/Memory work applied here as well, but I also implemented changes to how we loaded level data and other addressables so that we only kept the current dungeon room + the possible next rooms loaded at any time.</li>
            <li>UI Updates - We utilized Coherent Gameface with React for most of our in game UIs, including healthbars and other high update frequency combat information. I optimized the frequency of our Reactive value updates across all of our game elements and also refactored the React/Typescript side code to minimize the number of re-renders using a combination of memoization and code 'isDirty' comparison logic to limit the number of updates.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <div class=\"font-lg font-semibold mt-4\">Offline</div>
        <div class=\"mt-4\">Sadly, when this project came to an end we had to make the hard decision to convert the game to offline so that players who had purchased could continue to play without servers online. I unhooked all external systems except for Steam, removed all of our own API integrations, and reworked the core game such that players could play it connecting to their own instance as the server while still preserving all of the original gameplay elements.</div>
